## Our Business Model

### No GST Registration

SharaSpot currently operates below the GST registration threshold (₹40 lakhs annual turnover). This means:

- ✅ We cannot issue GST invoices
- ✅ We cannot charge GST separately
- ✅ All prices are inclusive and final
- ✅ Payment receipts (not tax invoices) are provided

This is **completely legal and compliant** with Indian tax laws for businesses under the threshold limit.

## Price Breakdown

Every charging session shows a clear breakdown:

### 1. **Energy Consumed**
   - Measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
   - Exact amount of electricity you used
   - Verified by smart charger meters

### 2. **Rate per kWh**
   - Set by charger owner
   - Displayed upfront before charging
   - Varies by location and charger type

### 3. **Charging Cost**
   - Simple calculation: Energy × Rate
   - Base cost for electricity consumed
   - No surprises, no hidden charges

### 4. **Platform Fee** (if applicable)
   - SharaSpot's service commission
   - Currently 5% of charging cost
   - Enables app development, support, and operations
   - Clearly displayed before payment

### 5. **Total Amount**
   - Sum of Charging Cost + Platform Fee
   - Final amount you pay
   - Inclusive of all charges

## FAQs

**Q: Can I claim tax deduction on charging expenses?**
A: For business use, you can claim expenses with our payment receipts. Consult your CA for specific tax advice.

**Q: Why don't you show GST separately?**
A: We're not GST registered, so we cannot charge GST or issue GST invoices. It's illegal to charge GST without registration.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Absolutely! Businesses under ₹40 lakhs turnover are not required to register for GST.

**Q: Will prices increase when you get GST registration?**
A: We'll be transparent about any changes. GST will be clearly shown as a separate line item.

**Q: Can I get a tax invoice instead of a receipt?**
A: No, we cannot issue tax invoices without GST registration. Our receipts are valid for expense claims.

**Q: What if a charger owner is GST registered?**
A: Their pricing already includes their GST obligations. We show their GST number for your reference.
